- In my opinion the best navigational pattern for this website is no navigation at all!
as this is basically a list that is added by the user, a quick search field added in the menu is the best way for the user to quickly find what they are looking for

- additionally the list could be enhanced by implemnting a sorting algorithm that runs when adding a new book.

- the book adding form was added in a dialog which deactivates anything else on the website as long as it's open.

- as the comment is the least important information it was hidden in a dialog to only be viewed when the user is considering the book
